* Add a visitor counter on the website 
* Have the visitor counter save and update to an Azure CosmosDB via API through Azure Functions written in Python
* Deploy the website to Azure Blob storage
* Setup a Azure CDN with a custom domain that points to the static website and has HTTPS only enabled
* Write a GitHub Actions workflow in YAML to upload the website files to Blob storage and purge the CDN endpoint whenever a new commit is done

## Additional steps
* Setup the entire project as Infrastructure as Code i.e Terraform

## My learning experience
Taking this challenge was very enlightening and intimidating because I've never worked with majority of the tools or programming languages before so the learning curve was very steep. I do have experience with Powershell and some knowledge of Java programming back in college that definitely helped when writing the Azure Function in Python and the JSON script to call it. Although it took a bit of time to complete, I am very happy that I took this challenge because I've learned an immense amount and am very eager to continue learning more.

My advice for anyone attempting the challenge that is a complete novice like myself; take your time and utilize all the documentation you can get your hands on!
